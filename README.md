# multi-agent

I am aming to recurrent the multi-agent code according to the paper "emergent tool use from multi-agent autocurricula" using the multi-agent enviroment provided by openai. I believe this work will relieve the barrier for the individual researcher to deep into human-like intellgence area. In fact, i will establish more realistic enviroments and testing tasks to evaluate the intelligence level of RL agents. 
Inspired by the evolution theory, i believe that social competence in agents' world will promote the improvement of intelligence level. Maybe, the group evolutional behavior will speed up the promotion process. After enough trainning, agents will find suprising solutions to some complex tasks out of human assumptions. Human-agent joint thinking will lead to stronger intelligence dealing with the problems beyond present thinking horizon. Now that human expert system exits, why not have a try in turn?
